# History

Core began development in mid-2019 as a Sonic Worlds fork, with the aim of correcting Sonic Worlds' inaccuracies and revamping it to match the Sonic Mania style. However, starting with version 0.23.0, we made the decision to rewrite everything from scratch to make use of the modern Clickteam Fusion features. 

We kept some of the same methods from Sonic Worlds where it made sense, but basically overhauled everything. We improved the collision system, sensors, angle detection, visual angle calculation, landing, ceiling landing, and physics.

We also rebuilt a ton of gimmicks and features from Delta with a brand new code, like actions, rings, monitors, spikes, platforms, bridges, and so on. A few things that were working well, like water tunnels, screw, and corkscrews, got adapted from Sonic Worlds Delta with a few tweaks. But pretty much everything else is all-new, written by us.
